## credits (linux only)

**Usage: credits [-f filename] [-t milliseconds]**

This console application loads a textfile and prints it character by character (in a typewriter fashion) to the standard output (ie. console). If a path to a textfile is specified after the '-f' option, then this file will be used; otherwise a default file named 'credits.txt' is implied. With the optional '-t' flag a user-defined delay (ie. the interval for the simulated keystrokes) in milliseconds can be specified (the default is 150ms).


## stack (work_in_progress)
